# Task 03 - Replace a Book Title
# Write a function called replace_book(books, old_book, new_book)
# that takes a list of book titles.
#
# If old_book is in the list, replace ONLY the first occurrence
# with new_book and return the updated list.
#
# If old_book is not in the list, return the original list unchanged.
#
# Example:
# replace_book(["Wonder", "Holes", "Matilda"], "Holes", "Hatchet")
# returns ["Wonder", "Hatchet", "Matilda"]

def replace_book(books, old_book, new_book):
    # Write your code here
    updated_book = books.replace("old_book", "new_book")
    pass
    return updated_book
